# Concept
The main goal of this project is to learn new code languages, delve into emerging technologies for robotics, and concurrently, establish a multirobot cooperative environment. The robots are intended for diverse applications, including agriculture, exploration, etc.

The planned code languages for learning are C++, Python, C#, web-oriented languages, and ROS. The project encompasses the acquisition of various technologies, such as machine learning algorithms, computer vision, sensor integration, LIDAR technologies, and the list may expand as new relevant technologies emerge.

The envisioned robots are designed to be cooperative, sharing data and executing tasks collaboratively. A key objective is to create a team of robots capable of exploring environments like caves. For instance, one robot could handle communication, another might generate energy for recharging, and different units would explore by air, sea, or land. All data collected would be transmitted to a central unit.

In agricultural scenarios, the same cooperative concept applies. Robots could be assigned tasks like spreading fertilizer or planting seeds, with seamless communication with a central station facilitating efficient coordination.
