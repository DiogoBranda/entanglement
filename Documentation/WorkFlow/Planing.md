## Starting a new project
A project within Entanglement represents a final product that introduces innovation. This could range from a complete robot to, for example, a central control station managing robots.

Repository Naming Convention:
Every project should possess its own repositories, adhering to the following pattern:
NameOfProject-Component

For common components reusable across various projects, they should be named as follows:
Common-Component

Repository Structure:
Within the 'entanglement' repository, under 'documentation/projects', a new folder should be created with the name of the project. This folder will house a detailed project description, including architecture diagrams and represented features.

Labeling and Board Creation:
A new label within the 'Area' group, bearing the name of the project, should be added. Additionally, a new board dedicated to the project should be created.

## Planing

The Planing of new projects should follow the representation showed on the diagram.
This enables a more granular approx, meaning that the definition of what should be done is easy to understand.
